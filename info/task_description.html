<p>
    You are standing next to a machine with two numeric inputs <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong>,
    and a single numeric output.
    It is known that the machine evaluates an expression using <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong>,
    the operators <strong>+&nbsp;–&nbsp;*&nbsp;/</strong> and <strong>brackets</strong>.
    You should recover the expression by using the machine on inputs of your choice in several turns.
    <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong> and the result are integers. There is using the integer division (<strong>/</strong>).
    For the division by zero the result will be <strong>"ZeroDivisionError"</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    Equivalent expressions will be accepted by the grader.
    For this the machine evaluates your expression and the hidden expression several times with random values.
</p>

<p>
    In each step your function get a list with data from the past steps.
    Each element is a list of three numbers -- <strong>x</strong>(int), <strong>y</strong>(int) and <strong>output</strong>(int or "ZeroDivisionError").
</p>

<p>
    The function should return a list with three elements -- your guess as an expression string, <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A list with data from the past steps.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A list with three elements -- your guess as an expression string, <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong>.
