<p>
    You are standing next to a machine with two numeric inputs <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong>,
    and a single numeric output.
    It is known that the machine evaluates an expression using <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong>,
    the operators <strong>+&nbsp;–&nbsp;*&nbsp;/</strong> and <strong>brackets</strong>.
    You should recover the expression by using the machine with inputs of your choice in several turns.
    <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong> and the result are integers.
    The division (<strong>/</strong>) in the expression is the integer division (5/2=2) .
    When dividing by zero, the result will evaluate to <strong>"ZeroDivisionError"</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    Equivalent expressions will be accepted by the grader.
    For this the machine evaluates your expression and the hidden expression several times, with random values.
</p>

<p>
    In each step, your function gets a list with data from the past steps.
    Each element is a list of three numbers -- <strong>x</strong>(int), <strong>y</strong>(int) and <strong>output</strong>(int or "ZeroDivisionError").
</p>

<p>
    The function should return a list with three elements -- your guess as an expression string, <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A list with data from the past steps.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A list with three elements -- your guess as an expression string, <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong>.

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">checkio([])  # hidden expression "x+y"
checkio([[2, 2, 4]]) # ["x-y", 3, 3]
checkio([[2, 2, 4], [3, 3, 6]])  # ["x+y", 5, 5]</pre>
