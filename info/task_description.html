    You are standing next to a machine with two numeric inputs <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong>,
    and a single numeric output.
    It is known that the machine evaluates an expression using <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong>,
    the operators <strong>+&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;*&nbsp;/</strong> and <strong>brackets</strong>.
    You should recover the expression by using the machine with inputs of your choice in several turns.
    <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong> and the result are integers.
    The machine uses real division(<strong>/</strong>) in the expression.
    When dividing by zero, the result will evaluate to <strong>"ZeroDivisionError"</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    Equivalent expressions will be accepted by the grader.
    For this the machine evaluates your expression and the hidden expression several times, with random values.
</p>

<p>
    In each step, your function gets a list with data from the past steps.
    Each element is a list of three numbers -- <strong>x</strong>(int), <strong>y</strong>(int) and
    <strong>output</strong>(a fraction as a list or the string "ZeroDivisionError").
    The output is represented as a list with two integers - numerator and denominator.
</p>

<p>
    The function should return a list with three elements --
    your guess as an expression string, <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong>, as integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A list with data from the past steps.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A list with three elements -- your guess as an expression string, <strong>x</strong> (int) and <strong>y</strong> (int).

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">checkio([])  # hidden expression "x+y"
checkio([[2, 2, [4, 1]]]) # ["x*y", 3, 3]
checkio([[2, 2, [4, 1]], [3, 3, [6, 1]]])  # ["x+y", 5, 5]</pre>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    As you can see from the title this is an example of the reverse engineering.
    This concept is using in cryptography and for analysis carious systems.
</p>


<p>
    <strong>Precondition: </strong> The hidden expression is correct. It does not evaluate at ZeroDivisionError always.<br>
